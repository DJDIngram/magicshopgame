# Magic Shop Game
2D Game Project in Unity!

Self taught C# and the Unity Ecosystem.
I learnt so much about working on large programming projects.
Everything from project organisation, to self-motivation and networking.
Not to mention programming design patterns, "manager" classes, events, OOP, events and more!

Can't wait to get stuck into some jams now :)
